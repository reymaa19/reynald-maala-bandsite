          <p class="about__details">
            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
            California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
            vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer.
            The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
            drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
            experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
            confident the band could succeed even further with more support,
            pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
          </p>
          <p class="about__details">
            From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition
            and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately
            fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude,
            solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and
            coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves
            as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic
            performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their
            second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
